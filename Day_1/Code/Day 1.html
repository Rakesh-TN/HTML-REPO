	<center><h1>HTML</h1></center>
	<p> The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. <br> It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. <br>
	Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.<br> HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.</p>

	<p> In 1980, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" target="-_blank">physicist Tim Berners-Lee </a>, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENQUIRE" target="-_blank">ENQUIRE</a>, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents.<br> In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.<br> Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990.<br> That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN.<br> In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.<br>
	The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags" first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.<br> It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML.<br> Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN.<br> Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4</p>

	<li>November 24, 1995 HTML 2.0 was published as RFC 1866. Supplemental RFCs added capabilities:</li>
	<li>November 25, 1995: RFC 1867 (form-based file upload)</li>
	<li>May 1996: RFC 1942 (tables)</li>
	<li>August 1996: RFC 1980 (client-side image maps)</li>
	<li>January 1997: RFC 2070 (internationalization)</li></p>

	<h4>HTML 3</h4>
	<ul type="none">
	<li>January 14, 1997 HTML was published as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium#W3C_recommendation_(REC)" target="-_blank"> W3C Recommendation.</a> 
	<li>It was the first version developed and standardized exclusively by the W3C, as the IETF had closed its HTML Working Group on September 12, 1996.</li>
	<li>Initially code-named "Wilbur", HTML 3.2 dropped math formulas entirely, reconciled overlap among various proprietary extensions and adopted most of Netscape's visual markup tags.</li>
	<li>Netscape's blink element and Microsoft's marquee element were omitted due to a mutual agreement between the two companies.</li> 
	<li>A markup for mathematical formulas similar to that of HTML was standardized 14 months later in MathML.</li>
	</ul>
<hr>
	<h5>HTML 4</h5>
	<p>December 18, 1997 HTML 4.0 was published as a W3C Recommendation.
	<ul type="circle">
	<li>It offers three variations:Strict, in which deprecated elements are forbidden Transitional, in which deprecated elements are allowed Frameset, in which mostly only frame related elements are allowed.</li> 
	<li>Initially code-named "Cougar", HTML 4.0 adopted many browser-specific element types and attributes, but also sought to phase out Netscape's visual markup features by marking them as deprecated in favor of style sheets.</li> 
	<li>HTML 4 is an SGML application conforming to ISO 8879 – SGML.<li>
	<li>April 24, 1998<br>
	HTML 4.0 was reissued with minor edits without incrementing the version number.</li>
	<li>December 24, 1999<br>
	HTML 4.01 was published as a W3C Recommendation.</li> 
	<li>It offers the same three variations as HTML 4.0 and its last errata were published on May 12, 2001.</li>
	<li>May 2000<br>
	ISO/IEC 15445:2000 ("ISO HTML", based on HTML 4.01 Strict) was published as an ISO/IEC international standard.</li> 
	<li>In the ISO, this standard is in the domain of the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 34 (ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1, Subcommittee 34 – Document description and processing languages).</li>
	<li>After HTML 4.01, there were no new versions of HTML for many years, as the development of the parallel, XML-based language XHTML occupied the W3C's HTML Working Group.</li></p>
